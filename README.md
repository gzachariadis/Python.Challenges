## Purpose

<p align="justify">This repository acts a diary, of sorts, to mark my own progress as I traverse the world of competitive programming and elevate my skill level to achieve Mastery of the Python language.</p>

<p align="justify">You can go peruse these exercises and try them yourself in any order you like. They are grouped by Platform, then difficulty level and finally alphabetically by their title for easy access.</p>

<i>Happy coding! </i> 🥳

## Coding Style 

<p align="justify">Almost every problem has a long, verbose and short, concise solution. IMHO, a long descriptive solution is almost always preferred over a cryptic one-liner. The exception being, a shared understanding of the code by the entire development team.</p>

<p align="justify">Having said that, in the process of tackling these challenges, I find myself opting for concise code with Pythonic syntax, as my main goal is to match the preferred [^1] solution to each individual challenge.</p>

## Repository Updates

<p align="justify">If you opt to watch this repository, you will notice a consistent effort to refactor and optimize my code. Sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability. Sometimes for both.</p>

<p align="justify">You might also find code be refractored as a more targeted solution to a generic problem. That happens because, in the process of tackling these challenges, small snippets of reusable code tend to arise, those, end up in my Visual Code Snippets (JSON) to be used when the opportunity emerges.</p>

## Lessons Learned

<p align="justify">Practicing algorithmic problems has helped me improve my algorithmic thinking. It has also helped me during interviews, by allowing me to be more confident with walking people through my thinking as I tackle problems.</p>

<p align="justify">Although, the Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there always a long way to go. The only way to truly emerge victorious is to focus on yourself and keep challenging him/her consistently.</p>

<p align="justify">On the same note, don't let failures stop you; not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.</p>

## Methodology

For larger problems, I tackle them recursively, this means that, I tend to go for the most verbose and intentionally slower solution, as I work my way to a more efficient and concise one. That's important both for understanding step by step what your algorithm is executing and for tackling problems in a logical sequence. With each iteration, I refactor my code, moving closer and closer to an optimal solution, before finally submitting my code for verification to any online platform.

Occasionally, two or more competing ways of solving a challenge will arise at the time of thinking the problem through and devising a solution, when that happens, if I can't immediately differentiate a best solution across the set, I pursure all, sequentially and let coding peformance and understandabillity differentiate between them. 

## Enviroment

As part of this exploration into competitive coding, I have created a seperate [repository](https://github.com/gzachariadis/Code-Wars); a local coding environment, functionally similar to most editors that are used by these platforms, as a means of  recursively testing my code's output and improving it before submitting my answer to the platform for further testing.

You can find the project [here](https://github.com/gzachariadis/Code-Wars) along with details on how to set it up for yourself.

## Performance

A quick way to compare between solution execution speeds is [Perfpy](https://perfpy.com/#/).

Additionally, included under [this project](https://github.com/gzachariadis/Python-Code-Performance) is my code performance tester, using [cProfiler](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/cprofile-how-to-profile-your-python-code/) where you can test the efficiency of your solutions or compare your answers with mine.

### Format???

- Title
   - You can use the Challenge Titles as external links to the original coding challenges.
- Date
   - Completion date for the Challenge.
- Objective
   - A Problem Description, varying in size, describing the problems's expected inputs and outputs.
- Problem Constraints
   - Limitations & Guidelines on the Problem.
- Solution(s)
   - Source Code
- Optional - Indicators
   - ✅ Indicates I achieved the Optimal Solution (as voted by the Platform's Users) on my first attempt.
   - 🏆 Indicates I achieve the 2nd best answer.
   - 🚩 Indicates a failure to match achieve a top 3 solution on the first try.
- Optional - Notes
   - Any notes or comments, I might have based my thought process on or took while solving the problem.
   - Will be included as comments on the python file or as a seperate .txt file.
