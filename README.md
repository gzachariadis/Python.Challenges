## Purpose

<p align="justify">This repository acts a diary, of sorts, to mark my own progress as I traverse the world of competitive programming and elevate my skill level to achieve Mastery of the Python language.</p>

## Coding Style 

<p align="justify">Almost every problem has a long, verbose and short, concise solution. IMHO, a long descriptive solution is almost always preferred over a cryptic one-liner. The exception being, a shared understanding of the code by the entire development team.</p>

<p align="justify">Having said that, in the process of tackling these challenges, I find myself opting for concise code with Pythonic syntax, as my main goal is to match the preferred [^1] solution to each individual challenge.</p>

## Repository Updates

<p align="justify">If you opt to watch this repository, you will notice a consistent effort to refactor and optimize my code. Sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability. Sometimes for both.</p>

<p align="justify">You might also find code be refractored as a more targeted solution to a generic problem. That happens because, in the process of tackling these challenges, small snippets of reusable code tend to arise, those, end up in my Visual Code Snippets (JSON) to be used when the opportunity emerges.</p>

## Lessons Learned

<p align="justify">Practicing algorithmic problems has helped me improve my algorithmic thinking. It has also helped me during interviews, by allowing me to be more confident with walking people through my thinking as I tackle problems.</p>

<p align="justify">Although, the Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there always a long way to go. The only way to truly emerge victorious is to focus on yourself and keep challenging him/her consistently.</p>

<p align="justify">On the same note, don't let failures stop you; not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.</p>
