## Purpose

<h3 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm George</h3>
<h4 align="center">A software engineer from Greece.</h4>

<p align="justify">This repository acts a diary, of sorts, to mark my own progress as I traverse the world of competitive programming and elevate my skill level to achieve Mastery of the Python language.</p>

<p align="justify">You can go peruse these exercises and try them yourself in any order you like. They are grouped by Platform of origin, then difficulty level and finally alphabetically by their title for easy access.</p>

<i>Happy coding! </i> ü•≥

## Coding Style 

<p align="justify">Almost every problem has a long, verbose and short, concise solution. IMHO, a long descriptive solution is almost always preferred over a cryptic one-liner. The exception being, a shared understanding of the code by the entire development team.</p>

<p align="justify">Having said that, in the process of tackling these challenges, I find myself opting for concise code with Pythonic syntax, as my main goal is to match the preferred solution (as voted by the platform's audience) to each individual challenge.</p>

## Repository Updates

<p align="justify">If you opt to watch this repository, you will notice a consistent effort to refactor and optimize my code. Sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability. Sometimes for both.</p>

<p align="justify">You might also find code be refractored as a more targeted solution to a generic problem. That happens because, in the process of tackling these challenges, small snippets of reusable code tend to arise, those, end up in my Visual Code Snippets (JSON) to be used when the opportunity emerges.</p>

## Lessons Learned

<p align="justify">Practicing algorithmic problems has helped me improve my algorithmic thinking. It has also helped me during interviews, by allowing me to be more confident with walking people through my thinking as I tackle problems.</p>

<p align="justify">Although, the Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there always a long way to go. The only way to truly emerge victorious is to focus on yourself and keep challenging him/her consistently.</p>

<p align="justify">On the same note, don't let failures stop you; not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.</p>

## Methodology

<p align="justify">The higher the difficulty, the more I tend to tackle problems recursively, this means that, I tend to go for the most verbose and intentionally slower solution at first; working my way to a more efficient and concise one.</p>

<p align="justify">Tackling problems in a logical sequence is vital to my process. With each iteration, I refactor my code, moving closer and closer to the optimal solution. By the time, I finally submit my code for verification to any online platform, I am positive my code is able to pass the test suite and has little to no room for improvement based on my current understanding and knowledge of Python.</p>

## Multiple Solutions

<p align="justify">As you might have noticed, some challenges include more than one solution, that's either because I attempted the challenge multiple times as my knowledge level progressed or because occasionally, two or more competing solutions will arise as I am thinking the problem through. When that happens, if I can't immediately differentiate the best solution across the set, I pursue them all, sequentially of course.</p>

<p align="justify">In case the resulting solutions are similar in nature and performance, then both are included for achiving purposes.</p>

## Enviroment

<p align="justify">As part of this exploration into competitive coding, I have created a seperate <a href="https://github.com/gzachariadis/Code-Wars" target="_blank">repository</a>; a local coding environment, functionally similar to most code editors, as a means of  recursively testing my code as I am improving it.</p>

<p align="justify">You can find the project <a href="https://github.com/gzachariadis/Code-Wars" target="_blank">here</a> along with details on how to set it up for yourself.</p>

## Performance

<p align="justify">A quick way to compare between solutions' execution speed is <a href="https://perfpy.com/#/" target="_black">Perfpy</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">Additionally, included under <a href="https://github.com/gzachariadis/Python-Code-Performance" target="_black">this project</a> is my code performance tester, using <a href="https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/cprofile-how-to-profile-your-python-code/" target="_black">cProfiler</a> where you can test the efficiency of your solutions or compare your answers with mine.</p>
