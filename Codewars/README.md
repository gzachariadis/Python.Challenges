# Overview

This folder contains a collection of Python solutions to Codewars[^3] challenges, grouped by ky≈´[^2]. Each kata[^1] is organized in a separate folder. [See Project Structure for more info]().

All solutions were solved on the official platform and verified against the original test suite. A date of completion is included in each solution for achiving purposes.

Your goal, should you choose to accept it, is to solve kata[^1] and progress through the ranks, to achieve Mastery[^4].

### Tips & Tricks

1.  Katas has `tags` that could help you in advance to know what to use.
    For example you could solve this kata using regular expressions.

2)  Katas could have some issues that goes beyond your implementation. If you're stuck check the `Issues`.
    Just click where it says `1 Issue Reported` above the `Instructions`.

3.  Finally check the `discussions` in case the Instructions aren't really clear.
    Click on the `Discuss` button under the `Sample Tests`.

4)  After you submit your final solution check the Solutions to learn from other alternatives. If you don't understand them you can leave a comment or check the discussions of each one. Try to learn from these solutions and improve your current one or create a Short Solution of your own.

5.  If you check my solutions the "Long Solution" maybe is longer than the "Short Solution" but is more readable.

6)  If you want to check what solution is faster use [jsPerf](https://jsperf.com) or [JSBench](https://jsbench.me)

#### Footnotes

[^1]: An algorithmic problem you have to solve in any programming language you desire. 

[^2]: A number between 1-8 that determines a [level based on subject area and difficulty](https://docs.codewars.com/curation/references/kata-ranks/). The more difficult the kata, the more points will be awarded upon solution.

[^3]: [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is an online educational platform for computer programming. On the platform, users known as "Code Warriors" attempt to solve programming challenges, known as kata, to practice programming skills and earn honor points. Each kata is assigned a ky≈´ rank based on its subject and difficulty.

[^4]: All code warriors start at 8 ky≈´ üëò and advance through the ranks to the final 4th dan ü•ã, achieving the rank of Master.
