# Overview

This folder contains a collection of Python solutions to Codewars[^3] challenges, grouped by kyÅ«[^2]. Each kata[^1] is organized in a separate folder based on Subject and Challenge Title accompanied by a task description, constraints and a solution source code. 

All solutions were solved on the official platform and verified against the original test suite.

Your goal, should you choose to accept it, is to solve kata[^1] and progress through the ranks, to achieve Mastery[^4].

[^1]: An algorithmic problem you have to solve in any programming language you desire. 

[^2]: A number between 1-8 that determines a [level based on subject area and difficulty](https://docs.codewars.com/curation/references/kata-ranks/). The more difficult the kata, the more points will be awarded upon solution.

[^3]: [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is an online educational platform for computer programming. On the platform, users known as "Code Warriors" attempt to solve programming challenges, known as kata, to practice programming skills and earn honor points. Each kata is assigned a kyÅ« rank based on its subject and difficulty.

[^4]: All code warriors start at 8 kyÅ« ðŸ‘˜ and advance through the ranks to the final 4th dan ðŸ¥‹, achieving the rank of Master.
