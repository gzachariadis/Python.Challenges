# Overview

Contained within this folder is a collection of Python solutions to Codewars[^3] kata[^1], grouped by ky≈´[^2]. 

Katas are ordered alphabetically based on their Title.

In case of questions, please refer to [Project Structure].

All solutions were solved on the official platform and verified against the original test suite. 

A date of completion is included in each solution for achiving purposes.

Solutions are often accompanied by a notes file, explaining the thought-process or steps behind the solution.

**Note:** The source code is written in Python 3 and may use language features that are incompatible with Python 2.

[^1]: An algorithmic problem you have to solve in any programming language you desire. 

[^2]: A number between 1-8 that determines a [level based on subject area and difficulty](https://docs.codewars.com/curation/references/kata-ranks/). The more difficult the kata, the more points will be awarded upon solution.

[^3]: [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is an online educational platform for computer programming. On the platform, users known as "Code Warriors" attempt to solve programming challenges, known as kata, to practice programming skills and earn honor points. Each kata is assigned a ky≈´ rank based on its subject and difficulty.

[^4]: All code warriors start at 8 ky≈´ üëò and advance through the ranks to the final 4th dan ü•ã, achieving the rank of Master.
