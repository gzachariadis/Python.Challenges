#### Footnotes

[^1]: An algorithmic problem you have to solve in any programming language you desire. 

[^2]: A number between 1-8 that determines a [level based on subject area and difficulty](https://docs.codewars.com/curation/references/kata-ranks/). The more difficult the kata, the more points will be awarded upon solution.

[^3]: [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is an online educational platform for computer programming. On the platform, users known as "Code Warriors" attempt to solve programming challenges, known as kata, to practice programming skills and earn honor points. Each kata is assigned a kyū rank based on its subject and difficulty.

[^4]: All code warriors start at 8 kyū 👘 and advance through the ranks to the final 4th dan 🥋, achieving the rank of Master.
